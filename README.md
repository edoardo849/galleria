# ProgImage.com

## Context
Unlike other image storage services that have a web frontend and target end-users, ProgImage is designed as a specialised image storage and processing engine to be used by other applications, and will (only) provide highperformance programmatic access via its API. 

Apart from bulk image storage and retrieval ProgImage provides a number of image processing and transformation capabilities such as compression, rotation, a variety of filters, thumbnail creation, and masking.

These capabilities are all delivered as a set of highperformance web-services that can operate on images provided as data in a request, operate on a remote image via a URL, or on images that are already in the repository. 

All of the processing features are able to operate in bulk, and at significant scale.
